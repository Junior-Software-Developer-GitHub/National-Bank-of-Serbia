# üìî What is it?

The National Bank of Serbia is a modern banking system. I created a database in Microsoft SQL that contains information about existing users. If the user has an account 
in our bank, he can see the information about him and the balance on the account, in addition user can withdraw money and a new balance in our database is
automatically updated. If the user does not have an account, there is an option for new users, where the user must fill in the fields such as their name,
surname, National ID number (unique), balance, PIN(unique). Unique means that we can have only one value for the National ID number and PIN.
